# Differentiable-slic
This project is a study on differentiable-slic, which uses superpixel sampling networks to obtain segmented optical flow

# Motion Segmentation Task 
`pytorch_ssn` package has the differentiable slic + optical flow functions. 

The optical flow we use here is using a method called `RAFT`
